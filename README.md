## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository is a **comprehensive deep-dive into PyTorch**, built on the principle of **understanding over copying**. Each module explores PyTorch's internal mechanics through practical implementation and real-world problem-solving.

### 🔍 What Makes This Different?

While most tutorials teach:
> *"Copy code → Run → Get accuracy"*

This repository focuses on:
- ✅ **Understanding the "how" and "why"** behind every component
- ✅ **Building from scratch** before using high-level abstractions  
- ✅ **Debugging common issues** (shapes, gradients, device mismatches)
- ✅ **Production-ready patterns** with modular, clean code
- ✅ **Real-world computer vision applications** with deployment

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

**Real ML engineering requires:**
- Understanding data flow through model layers
- Debugging batch sizes, steps per epoch, and DataLoader behavior
- Fixing shape mismatches and training instabilities
- Writing clean, reproducible training pipelines

This is my **PyTorch mastery journey** — documented with clarity and depth.

## 🔬 Deep Dive: Key Concepts Mastered

### 1️⃣ **DataLoader & Batching Clarity**

Understanding the mechanics, not just the API:
```python
# What does len(train_dataloader) actually mean?
dataset_size = 1000
batch_size = 32

steps_per_epoch = len(train_dataloader)  # → 32 steps
# Why? 1000 ÷ 32 = 31.25 → rounds up to 32
```

**What I've mastered:**
- Batch size vs dataset size
- Steps per epoch calculation
- Shuffling and sampling strategies
- Memory-efficient data loading

---

### 2️⃣ **Model Architecture Internals**

Layer-by-layer understanding:
```python
class CustomCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # Understanding WHY each layer is needed
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3)  # Input: (B, 3, H, W)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)                # Output: (B, 64, H/2, W/2)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Tracking shapes at every step
        print(f"Input shape: {x.shape}")
        x = self.conv1(x)  # Shape transformation
        print(f"After conv1: {x.shape}")
        return x
```

**What I've mastered:**
- Shape transformations through layers
- Parameter counting and memory usage
- Forward pass mechanics
- Output shape prediction

---

### 3️⃣ **Training Pipeline Deep Understanding**

Not just running code, but understanding the flow:
```python
for epoch in range(epochs):
    model.train()  # Why is this needed?
    
    for X_batch, y_batch in train_dataloader:
        # 1. Forward pass
        y_pred = model(X_batch)
        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch)
        
        # 2. Backward pass
        optimizer.zero_grad()  # Why zero first?
        loss.backward()        # Gradient computation
        optimizer.step()       # Weight update
```

**What I've mastered:**
- Gradient accumulation and zeroing
- Loss landscape understanding
- Optimizer behavior (SGD, Adam)
- Learning rate scheduling
- Overfitting detection and prevention

---

### 4️⃣ **Debugging Common PyTorch Errors**

Real-world problem solving:

| Error | Root Cause | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied` | Shape mismatch | Track tensor shapes through forward pass |
| `RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device` | CPU/GPU mismatch | Use `.to(device)` consistently |
| `RuntimeError: Trying to backward through the graph a second time` | Gradient accumulation issue | Call `optimizer.zero_grad()` before each batch |
